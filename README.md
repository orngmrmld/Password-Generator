# Password-Generator

##Description
This is a password generator that utilizes alerts and prompts to ask the user what kind of password they would like to generate. After clicking the "generate password" button, the user is prompted with options. Option 1 generates a password based only on a length given between 8 and 128 characters (this will use both upper and lowercase characters and numbers). The user can choose option 2, which allows the user to choose to include lowercase or uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters (this option defaults to a length of 8 characters regardless of what content options user chooses). The third option allows you to choose both a length criteria and a content criteria. After answering the prompts, a password is then generated in the text box on the page.
